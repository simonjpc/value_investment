### Next steps

These is the list of tasks to do that do not depend on any other task :

- Code unit tests for the functions of script `extractor.py`. Here some mockup will be needed.
- Create script where the calculations of the EPS X valuation is done using the functions from `eps_multiple.py`.
- Add/create functions that compute the liquidation value and ncav.
- Add utils functions used for the liquidation/ncav calculations.
